The old man lived a long life; he experienced more than the other two men in the story. This experience has brought him to the misery that he now faces. He is deaf which is a physical characteristic that has been lost with age. The deafness in the old man symbolizes degradation of the quality of life as humans age. After living so long, the old man lacks some of the gifts that people are born with that the young man takes for granted. The old man’s long life shows that as humans age, the length of time they have been around not only ages their body, but it ages their soul. Old men do not feel all the happiness and comfort that they once felt as a young man. 
Seeing the contrast between the old man and the young man shows drastic differences in the views about life that they each hold. The middle aged man falls between these two endpoints on the life scale. The middle aged man empathizes with the oldest man and understands his viewpoint about life. It is something that the youngest man will not be able to grasp until he has lived longer. The longer a life a man lives, the more jaded and unhappy he becomes. This is proved perfectly in the story. The young man dislikes having to stay late in the café, the middle aged man cannot sleep well at night, and the old man tried to kill himself. Only the young man who has not experienced nothingness is somewhat happy in the story.
The main message of the story is we should cope with the nothingness present in the world so that it does not overwhelm us.  This nothingness is present in our lives as well. It is just not always apparent. Both characters that faced the nothingness had ways of coping with it—the old man had his alcohol, the middle-aged man kept the café open late so that other men could go there to forget the nothingness—if only for a short while. The story also shows what happens when one cannot cope with the nothingness with the old man’s attempted suicide. Hemingway himself was addicted to alcohol, much like the old man. It was his coping mechanism for the nothingness he wrote about. However, Hemingway could not cope forever after becoming ill and eventually killed himself.
	Perhaps, Hemingway did not fully understand the gravity of the nothingness he wrote about, and knew one day when he was older, he would. Or maybe, he did understand, but had more to share with humanity before his inevitable death. Maybe still, he was forecasting his own suicide twenty-eight years before it happened. No matter what Hemingway might have felt at the time, the deep nothingness that he shows in “A Clean Well-Lighted Place,” is a nothingness that pervades the story and becomes more apparent to the characters as they age as humans do not last forever. Ernest Hemingway wrote much about the struggle to cope with the nothingness in the world, but eventually succumbed to the nothingness that he wrote about.

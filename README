To run JGAAP in Windows, click on the jgaap.jar file in the bin directory.

On Unix-based systems, or from the Windows command-line, you can also run:

java -jar jgaap.jar

NOTE: It is suggested that you increase the Heap size alloted to the JVM 
     when using JGAAP since it is very memory intensive 2GB is good for 
     most applications

java -Xmx2048m -jar jgaap.jar

from the bin directory.


JGAAP also has a command line mode.  You can see the command 
line options by running:

java -jar jgaap.jar help


JGAAP also comes with a ant build file in the src and bin directories.  
To compile the system:

ant build

To launch the gui:

ant run-gui
